\section{Introduction}

A slope of geological mass, composed of soil and rock and sometimes water, is 
subject to the influence of gravity on the mass. This can cause instability in 
the form of soil or rock movement. The effects of soil or rock movement can 
range from inconvenient to seriously hazardous, resulting in significant life 
and economic losses. Slope stability is of interest both when analysing natural 
slopes, and when designing an excavated slope. Slope stability analysis is the 
assessment of the safety of a slope, identifying the surface most likely to 
experience slip and an index of its relative stability known as the factor of 
safety.

~\newline
The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements 
Specification (SRS) for a slope stability analysis problem. The developed 
program will be referred to as the Slope Stability analysis Program 
(\progname). This section explains the purpose of this document, the 
scope of the system, the characteristics of the intended readers, and the 
organization of the document.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of  
\progname{} and the models that will be used to meet those requirements. Goals, 
 assumptions,  theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation 
 information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify 
 the purpose and scientific basis of \progname. With the exception of system 
 constraints in Section \ref{sec_SystConstraints}, this SRS will remain 
 abstract, describing \textit{what} problem is being solved, but not 
 \textit{how} to solve it.
~\newline

\noindent This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent 
development 
phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification
 and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements
 are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and 
programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show
 the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software 
 documentation
 and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents 
that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process
 is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, 
as \cite{ParnasAndClements1986} point out, the most logical 
way to present the documentation is still to ``fake" a rational design process.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

The scope of the requirements includes stability analysis of a 2-dimensional 
slope, composed of homogeneous soil layers. The analysis will be at an instant 
in time; factors that may change the slope properties over time will not be 
considered.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader}
\label{Sec:CharofInteRead}
Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of undergraduate 
Level 4 physics and should have completed a second year or higher level 
undergraduate course in solid mechanics. The users of \progname\ can have a 
lower level of expertise, as explained in Section~\ref{Sec:UserChar}.

\subsection{Organization of Document}

The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for
scientific computing software proposed by~\cite{Koothoor2013} and
\cite{SmithAndLai2005}.  The presentation follows the standard pattern
of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions.  For
readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start
reading the instance models in Section \ref{sec_instance} and trace
back to find any additional information they require. The goal statements 
(Section \ref{sec_Goals}) are refined to the theoretical models, and the 
theoretical models (Section \ref{sec_theoretical}) to the instance models 
(Section \ref{sec_instance}). The instance models provide the set of algebraic 
equations that must be solved.

%\subsection{Intended Audience}

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system. It identifies the 
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user 
characteristics, and lists the system constraints.

\subsection{System Context}

Figure~\ref{Fig_SystemContext} shows the system context.  A circle represents an
external entity outside the software.  A rectangle represents the software 
system itself (\progname).  Arrows are used to show the data flow between the 
system and its environment.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{SystemContextFigure.png}
		\caption{System Context}
		\label{Fig_SystemContext}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent The responsibilities of the user and the system are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Provide the input data related to the soil layer(s) and water table (if 
  applicable), ensuring conformation to input data format required by \progname
  \item Ensure that consistent units are used for input variables
  \item Ensure required software assumptions (Section~\ref{Assumptions}) are
    appropriate for the problem to which the user is applying the software
  \end{itemize}
\item \progname\ Responsibilities:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters input instead
    of a floating point number
  \item Verify that the inputs satisfy the required physical constraints and 
  other data constraints (Section \ref{sec_DataConstraints})
  \item Identify the critical slip surface within the possible input range
  \item Find the factor of safety for the slope
  \item Find the interslice normal and shear forces along the critical slip 
  surface
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{Sec:UserChar}
The end user of \progname\ should have an understanding of undergraduate
Level 1 Calculus and Physics, and be familiar with soil and material
properties, specifically cohesion, effective angle of friction, and unit weight.

\subsection{System Constraints} \label{sec_SystConstraints}

The Morgenstern-Price method, which involves dividing the slope into vertical 
slices, will be used to derive the equations for analysing the slope. 

\section{Specific System Description}

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a
high-level view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the
solution characteristics specification, which presents the
assumptions, theories, definitions and finally the instance models.

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

\progname\ is a computer program developed to evaluate the factors of safety 
for a slope's slip surfaces and identify the critical slip surface of the 
slope, as well as the interslice normal and shear forces along the critical 
slip surface. It is intended to be used as an educational tool for introducing 
slope stability issues, and to facilitate the analysis and design of a safe 
slope.

\subsubsection{Terminology and Definitions}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and
 making it easier to correctly understand the requirements.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\textit{Factor of safety:} The global stability metric of a slip surface 
of a slope.}
  
\item {\textit{Slip surface:} A surface within a slope that has the potential 
to fail or displace due to load or other forces.}

\item {\textit{Critical slip surface:} Slip surface of the slope that
  has the lowest factor of safety, and is therefore most likely to
  experience failure.}

\item {\textit{Water table:} The upper boundary of a saturated zone in the 
ground.}

\item {\textit{Stress:} Force applied over an area.}
  
\item {\textit{Strain:} A measure of deformation of a body or plane under 
stress.}
  
\item {\textit{Normal force:} A force applied perpendicular to the
  plane of the material.}
  
\item {\textit{Shear force:} A force applied parallel to the plane of
  the material.}

\item {\textit{Resistive shear force:} Shear force in the direction opposite of 
the direction of potential motion, thus hindering motion along the plane.}
	
\item {\textit{Mobile shear force:} Shear force in the direction of potential 
motion, thus encouraging motion along the plane.}
	
\item {\textit{Cohesion:} An attractive force between adjacent particles that 
holds the matter together.}
  
\item {\textit{Isotropic:} A condition where the value of a property is 
independent of the direction in which it is measured.}
  
\item {\textit{Plane strain:} A condition where the resultant stresses in one 
of the directions of a 3-dimensional material can be approximated as
  zero. Results when the length of one dimension of the body dominates
  the others. Stresses in the direction of the dominant dimension can be 
  approximated as zero.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_system}

The physical system of \progname{}, as shown in Figure~\ref{Fig_PhysSyst}, 
includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item[PS1:] A slope comprised of one or more layers of soil.
\item[PS2:] A water table within the soil layers, which may or may not exist.
\end{itemize}

			\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{PhysSyst.png}
		}
		\caption{An example slope for analysis by SSP}
		\label{Fig_PhysSyst}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

~\newline\noindent Morgenstern-Price analysis of the slope involves 
representing the slope as a series of vertical slices. As shown in 
Figure~\ref{Fig_Index}, the index $i$ is used to denote a value for a single 
slice, and an interslice value at a given index $i$ refers to the value between 
slice $i$ and adjacent slice \textit{i+1}.

\subsubsection{Goal statements} \label{sec_Goals}

Given the geometry of the soil layers and water table composing the plane of a 
slope and the material properties of the layers, the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}
\item [GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum: \label{G_FS}]
  {Evaluate the factors of safety for possible slip surfaces along the slope.}
  
\item [GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum: \label{G_Critical}]
  {Identify the critical slip surface for the slope, with the lowest factor of 
  safety.}

\item [GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum: \label{G_Normal}]
  {Determine the interslice normal force between each pair of vertical slices   
  of the slope.}
  
\item [GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum: \label{G_Shear}]
  {Determine the interslice shear force between each pair of vertical slices of 
  the slope.} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}

The instance models that govern \progname\ are presented in
Section~\ref{sec_instance}.  The information to understand the
meaning of the instance models and their derivation is also presented,
so that the instance models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\label{Assumptions}
This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the
theoretical models by filling in the missing information for the physical
system. The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model
[T], general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or
likely change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

\begin{enumerate}[label=A\arabic*:,ref={\arabic*}]
\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_Concave}] The
  slip surface is concave with respect to the slope surface. The 
  $(x_{\text{slip}},y_{\text{slip}})$ coordinates of a slip surface follow a 
  concave up 
  function. [\iref{IM_Min}]

\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_Constant}] The factor 
of safety is assumed to be constant across a whole slip surface. 
[\dref{GD_MobShear}, \iref{IM_FS}, \iref{IM_E}]

\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_Homo}] The
  different layers of the soil are homogeneous, with consistent soil
  properties throughout. [\dref{GD_P}, \dref{GD_MobShear}, \dref{GD_R}, 
  \dref{GD_T}, \lcref{LC_inhomogeneous}]
  
\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_Saturated}] The soil 
properties are independent of dry or saturated conditions, with the exception 
of unit weight. [\dref{GD_P}, \dref{GD_MobShear}, \dref{GD_R}, 
\dref{GD_T}]

\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_Isotropic}]
  Soil layers are treated as if they have isotropic properties. [\dref{GD_P}, 
  \dref{GD_MobShear}, \dref{GD_R}, \dref{GD_T}]
  
\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_Base}]
  Interslice normal and shear forces have a proportional relationship,
  depending on a proportionality constant $\left({\lambda}\right)$ and a
  function $\left({f}\right)$ describing variation depending on $x$
  position. [\dref{GD_X}, \iref{IM_FS}, \iref{IM_Lambda}, \iref{IM_E}]
  
\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_2D}] The
  slope and slip surface extends far into and out of the geometry 
  ($z$-coordinate). This implies plane strain conditions, making 2D
  analysis appropriate. [\tref{TM_Eqm}]

\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_Lin}] The
  effective normal stress is large enough that the resistive shear to
  effective normal stress relationship can be approximated as a linear
  relationship. [\tref{TM_Fmc}, \dref{GD_EffNormal}]

\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_Straight}]
  The surface and base of a slice are approximated as straight lines 
  [\ddref{DD_Ub}, \ddref{DD_Ut}, \ddref{DD_Angles_alpha}, 
  \ddref{DD_Angles_Beta}, \ddref{DD_lb}, \ddref{DD_ls}].
  
\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_EdgeSlices}] The 
interslice forces at the \textit{0}th and \textit{n}th interslice interfaces 
are zero. [\iref{IM_FS}, \iref{IM_Lambda}, \iref{IM_E}].
  
\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_Seismic}] There is no 
seismic force acting on the slope. [\dref{GD_R}, \dref{GD_T}, \iref{IM_FS}, 
\iref{IM_Lambda}, \iref{IM_E}, \lcref{LC_Seismic}]
  
\item [A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum: \label{A_External}] There is 
no imposed surface load, and therefore no external force, acting on the slope. 
[\dref{GD_R}, \dref{GD_T}, \iref{IM_FS}, \iref{IM_Lambda}, \iref{IM_E},

\subsubsection{Instance Models} \label{sec_instance}

This section transforms the problem defined in the
Section~\ref{Sec_pd} into one which is expressed in mathematical
terms. It uses concrete symbols defined in Section~\ref{sec_datadef}
to replace the abstract symbols in the models identified in the
Sections~\ref{sec_theoretical} and ~\ref{sec_gendef}.

~\newline\noindent The goals \gsref{G_FS}, \gsref{G_Normal}, and 
\gsref{G_Shear} are met by the simultaneous solution of \iref{IM_FS}, 
\iref{IM_Lambda}, and \iref{IM_E}. The goal \gsref{G_Critical} is met by
\iref{IM_Min}.

~\newline\noindent The Morgenstern-Price Method is a vertical slice,
limit equilibrium slope stability analysis method. Analysis is
performed by breaking the assumed slip surface into a series of
vertical slices of mass. Static equilibrium analysis is performed, using two 
force equations and one moment equation as in \tref{TM_Eqm}. The problem
is statically indeterminate with only these 3 equations and one
constitutive equation (the Mohr-Coulomb shear strength of
\tref{TM_Fmc}), so the assumption \aref{A_Base} and corresponding equation 
\dref{GD_X} are used. The force equilibrium equations can be modified to be 
expressed only in terms of known physical values, as done in \dref{GD_R} and 
\dref{GD_T}.

\subsubsection*{Factor of Safety Derivation}

The mobile shear force defined in \dref{GD_Fy} can be substituted into the 
definition of mobile shear force based on the factor of safety, from 
\dref{GD_MobShear}, yielding Equation~\ref{eq:MobileShear} below.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:MobileShear}
\left( \begin{array}{l} \left[
W_{i} -X_{i-1} + X_{i} +
{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\cos\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
Q_{i}\;{\cos\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
\right]\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \\ - \left[
{-K_{\text{c}}}\;{W_{i}} - G_{i} + G_{i-1}
- H_{i} + H_{i-1} +
{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\sin\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
Q_{i}\;{\cos\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
\right]\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \end{array} \right)\\ = \frac { 
N'_{i} \cdot \tan\left( \varphi'_{i}
	\right) + c'_i \cdot \ell_{b,i} }{F_\text{S}}
\end{equation}

\noindent An expression for the effective normal force, $N'_i$, can be derived 
by substituting the normal force equilibrium from \dref{GD_Fx} into the 
definition for effective normal force from \dref{GD_EffNormal}. This results in 
Equation~\ref{eq:N'}.
	
\begin{equation} \label{eq:N'}
N'_{i} \; = \begin{array}{l}
\left[ W_{i} - X_{i-1} + X_{i} +
{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\cos\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
Q_{i}\;{\cos\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
\right]\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \\ + \left[
{-K_{\text{c}}}\;{W_{i}} - G_{i} + G_{i-1} -
H_{i} + H_{i-1} +
{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\sin\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
Q_{i}\;{\sin\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
\right]\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \\ -
U_{\text{b,i}} \end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent Substituting Equation~\ref{eq:N'} into Equation~\ref{eq:MobileShear} 
gives

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l} \left( \begin{array}{l} \left[
W_{i} -X_{i-1} + X_{i} +
{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\cos\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
Q_{i}\;{\cos\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
\right]\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \\ - \left[
{-K_{\text{c}}}\;{W_{i}} - G_{i} + G_{i-1}
- H_{i} + H_{i-1} +
{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\sin\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
Q_{i}\;{\cos\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
\right]\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \end{array} \right) =\\ \frac { 
	\left( \begin{array}{l}
	\left[ W_{i} - X_{i-1} + X_{i} +
	{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\cos\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
	Q_{i}\;{\cos\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
	\right]\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \\ + \left[
	{-K_{\text{c}}}\;{W_{i}} - G_{i} + G_{i-1} -
	H_{i} + H_{i-1} +
	{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\sin\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
	Q_{i}\;{\sin\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
	\right]\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right) -
	U_{\text{b,i}} \end{array} \right) \cdot \tan\left( \varphi'_{i}
	\right) + c'_i \cdot \ell_{b,i} }{F_\text{S}} \end{array}
\end{equation*}

\noindent Since the interslice shear force $X$ and interslice normal force $G$ 
are unknown, they are separated from the other terms as follows:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l} \left( \begin{array}{l} \left[
		W_{i} +
		{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\cos\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
		Q_{i}\;{\cos\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
		\right]\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right) + \left(-X_{i-1} + 
		X_{i}\right)\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right)\\ - \left[
		{-K_{\text{c}}}\;{W_{i}}
		- H_{i} + H_{i-1} +
		{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\sin\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
		Q_{i}\;{\cos\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
		\right]\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) - \left(- G_{i} + 
		G_{i-1}\right)\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \end{array} 
		\right) =\\ \frac 
		{ 
		\left( \begin{array}{l}
			\left[ W_{i} +
			{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\cos\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
			Q_{i}\;{\cos\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
			\right]\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) + \left(- X_{i-1} 
			+ X_{i}\right)\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \\ + \left[
			{-K_{\text{c}}}\;{W_{i}} -
			H_{i} + H_{i-1} +
			{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\sin\left(\beta_{i}\right)} +
			Q_{i}\;{\sin\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
			\right]\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right) + \left(- G_{i} + 
			G_{i-1}\right)\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right)\\ -
			U_{\text{b,i}} \end{array} \right) \cdot \tan\left( 
			\varphi'_{i}
		\right) + c'_i \cdot \ell_{b,i} }{F_\text{S}} \end{array}
\end{equation*}

\noindent Applying assumptions \aref{A_Seismic} and \aref{A_External}, which 
state that the seismic coefficient and the external force, respectively, are 
zero, allows for further simplification as shown below.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l} \left( \begin{array}{l} \left[
W_{i} +
{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\cos\left(\beta_{i}\right)}
\right]\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right) + \left(-X_{i-1} + 
X_{i}\right)\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right)\\ - \left[
{- H_{i} + H_{i-1} +
{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\sin\left(\beta_{i}\right)}}
\right]\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right)
 - \left(- G_{i} + 
G_{i-1}\right)\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \end{array} 
\right) =\\ \frac 
{ 
	\left( \begin{array}{l}
	\left[ W_{i} +
	{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\cos\left(\beta_{i}\right)}
	\right]\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) + \left(- X_{i-1} 
	+ X_{i}\right)\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \\ + \left[
	{- H_{i} + H_{i-1} +
	{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\sin\left(\beta_{i}\right)}}
	\right]\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right) + \left(- G_{i} + 
	G_{i-1}\right)\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right) -
	U_{\text{b,i}} \end{array} \right) \cdot \tan\left( 
	\varphi'_{i}
	\right) + c'_i \cdot \ell_{b,i} }{F_\text{S}} \end{array}
\end{equation*}

\noindent The definitions of \dref{GD_R} and \dref{GD_T} are present in this 
equation, and can thus be replaced by $R_i$ and $T_i$, respectively.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l} \left( T_{i} + \left(-X_{i-1} + 
X_{i}\right)\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right)
- \left(- G_{i} + 
G_{i-1}\right)\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right)
\right) =\\ \frac 
{ 
	R_{i} + \left(\left(- X_{i-1} 
	+ X_{i}\right)\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) + \left(- 
	G_{i} + 
	G_{i-1}\right)\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \right) \cdot 
	\tan\left( 
	\varphi'_{i}
	\right) + c'_i \cdot \ell_{b,i} }{F_\text{S}} \end{array}
\end{equation*}

\noindent The interslice shear force $X$ can be expressed in terms of the 
interslice normal force $G$ using \dref{GD_X}, resulting in

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l} \left( T_{i} + \left(-\lambda f_{i-1} 
G_{i-1} + \lambda f_i 
G_{i}\right)\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right)
- \left(- G_{i} + 
G_{i-1}\right)\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right)
\right) =\\ \frac 
{ 
	R_{i} + \left(\left(-\lambda f_{i-1} 
	G_{i-1} + \lambda f_i 
	G_{i}\right)\cos\left(\alpha_{i}\right) + \left(- 
	G_{i} + 
	G_{i-1}\right)\sin\left(\alpha_{i}\right) \right) \cdot 
	\tan\left( 
	\varphi'_{i}
	\right)}{F_\text{S}} \end{array}
\end{equation*}

\noindent Rearranging yields the following:

\begin{equation*}
G_i \left[ \begin{array}{l} \left[ \lambda \cdot f_i
\cos\left(\alpha_i\right) -
\sin\left(\alpha_i\right) \right]
\tan\left(\varphi'\right._{i}) \\ - \left[ \lambda \cdot f_i
\sin\left(\alpha_i\right) +
\cos\left(\alpha_i\right) \right.]
\left(F_\text{S}\right) \end{array} \right] = G_{i-1}
\left[ \begin{array}{l} \left[ \lambda \cdot f_{i-1}
\cos\left(\alpha_i\right) -
\sin\left(\alpha_i\right) \right]
\tan\left(\varphi'\right._{i}) 
\\ - \left[ \lambda \cdot f_{i-1}
\sin\left(\alpha_i\right) +
\cos\left(\alpha_i\right) \right]
\left(F_\text{S}\right) \end{array} \right] +
\left(F_\text{S}\right) \cdot T_i - R_i
\end{equation*}

\noindent The definitions for $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ from \ddref{DD_Phi} and 
\ddref{DD_Psi} simplify the above to Equation~\ref{eq:Gi}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Gi}
G_i \Phi_i = \Psi_{i-1} G_{i-1} \Phi_{i-1} + 
F_\text{S} 
T_i - R_i
\end{equation}

\noindent Versions of Equation~\ref{eq:Gi} instantiated for slices 1 to $n$ are 
shown below.

\begin{equation*}
G_\text{1} \Phi_\text{1} = \Psi_\text{0} G_\text{0} \Phi_\text{0} + F_\text{S} 
T_\text{1} - R_\text{1}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:G2}
G_\text{2} \Phi_\text{2} = \Psi_\text{1} G_\text{1} \Phi_\text{1} + F_\text{S} 
T_\text{2} - R_\text{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:G3}
G_\text{3} \Phi_\text{3} = \Psi_\text{2} G_\text{2} \Phi_\text{2} + F_\text{S} 
T_\text{3} - R_\text{3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
...
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Gn-2}
G_\text{n-2} \Phi_\text{n-2} = \Psi_\text{n-3} G_\text{n-3} 
\Phi_\text{n-3} + F_\text{S} T_\text{n-2} - R_\text{n-2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Gn-1}
G_\text{n-1} \Phi_\text{n-1} = \Psi_\text{n-2} G_\text{n-2} 
\Phi_\text{n-2} + F_\text{S} T_\text{n-1} - R_\text{n-1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
G_\text{n} \Phi_\text{n} = \Psi_\text{n-1} G_\text{n-1} \Phi_\text{n-1} + 
F_\text{S} T_\text{n} - R_\text{n}
\end{equation*}

\noindent Applying \aref{A_EdgeSlices}, which says that $G_{0}$ and $G_{n}$ are 
zero, results in the following special cases: Equation~\ref{eq:G0} for the 
first slice and Equation~\ref{eq:Gn} for the $n$th slice.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:G0}
G_\text{1} \Phi_\text{1} = F_\text{S} T_\text{1} - R_\text{1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Gn}
- \frac{F_\text{S} T_\text{n} - R_\text{n}}{\Psi_\text{n-1} } = G_\text{n-1} 
\Phi_\text{n-1}
\end{equation}

\noindent Substituting Equation~\ref{eq:G0} into Equation~\ref{eq:G2} yields 
Equation~\ref{eq:G2sub}, which can be substituted into Equation~\ref{eq:G3} to 
get Equation~\ref{eq:G3sub}, and so on until Equation~\ref{eq:Gn-1sub} is 
obtained from Equation~\ref{eq:Gn-1}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:G2sub}
G_\text{2} \Phi_\text{2} = \Psi_\text{1} \left(F_\text{S} T_\text{1} - 
R_\text{1} 
\right) + F_\text{S} T_\text{2} - R_\text{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:G3sub}
G_\text{3} \Phi_\text{3} = \Psi_\text{2} \left( \Psi_\text{1} \left(F_\text{S} 
T_\text{1} - R_\text{1} 
\right) + F_\text{S} T_\text{2} - R_\text{2} \right) + F_\text{S} 
T_\text{3} - R_\text{3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
\dots
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Gn-1sub}
\begin{split}
G_\text{n-1} \Phi_\text{n-1} = & \Psi_\text{n-2} \left(
\Psi_\text{n-3} \left( 
\dots \left( \Psi_\text{1} \left(F_\text{S} 
T_\text{1} - R_\text{1} 
\right) + F_\text{S} T_\text{2} - R_\text{2} \right) \dots \right) + F_\text{S} 
T_\text{n-2} - R_\text{n-2} \right) \\& + F_\text{S} 
T_\text{n-1} - R_\text{n-1} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

~\newline

\noindent Equation~\ref{eq:Gn} can then be substituted into the left-hand side 
of Equation~\ref{eq:Gn-1sub}, resulting in:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
- \frac{F_\text{S} T_\text{n} - R_\text{n}}{\Psi_\text{n-1} } = & 
\Psi_\text{n-2} 
\left(
\Psi_\text{n-3} \left( 
\dots \left( \Psi_\text{1} \left(F_\text{S} 
T_\text{1} - R_\text{1} 
\right) + F_\text{S} T_\text{2} - R_\text{2} \right) \dots \right) + F_\text{S} 
T_\text{n-2} - R_\text{n-2} \right) \\& + F_\text{S} 
T_\text{n-1} - R_\text{n-1} 
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\noindent This can be rearranged by multiplying both sides by $\Psi_\text{n-1}$ 
and then distributing the multiplication of each $\Psi$ over addition to obtain:

\begin{equation*}
- \left( F_\text{S} T_\text{n} - R_\text{n} \right) = \Psi_\text{n-1} 
\Psi_\text{n-2} 
\dots \Psi_\text{1} \left( F_\text{S} T_\text{1} - R_\text{1} \right) + 
\Psi_\text{n-1} \Psi_\text{n-2} \dots \Psi_\text{2} \left( F_\text{S} 
T_\text{2} - R_\text{2} \right) + \dots + \Psi_\text{n-1} \left( F_\text{S} 
T_\text{n-1} - R_\text{n-1} \right)
\end{equation*}

\noindent The multiplication of the $\Psi$ terms can be further distributed 
over the subtractions, resulting in the equation having terms that each either 
contain an $R$ or a $T$. The equation can then be rearranged so terms 
containing an $R$ are on one side of the equality, and terms containing a $T$ 
are on the other. The multiplication by the factor of safety is common to all 
of the $T$ terms, and thus can be factored out, resulting in:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
F_\text{S} \left( \Psi_\text{n-1} \Psi_\text{n-2} \dots \Psi_\text{1} 
T_\text{1} + \Psi_\text{n-1} \Psi_\text{n-2} \dots \Psi_\text{2} T_\text{2} + 
\dots \Psi_\text{n-1} T_\text{n-1} + T_\text{n} \right) =&\\ \Psi_\text{n-1} 
\Psi_\text{n-2} 
\dots \Psi_\text{1} R_\text{1} + \Psi_\text{n-1} \Psi_\text{n-2} \dots 
\Psi_\text{2} R_\text{2} + \dots + \Psi_\text{n-1} R_\text{n-1} + R_\text{n}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\noindent Isolating the factor of safety on the left-hand side and using 
compact notation 
for the products and sums yields Equation~\ref{eq:FS}, which can also be seen 
in \iref{IM_FS}. $F_\text{S}$ depends on the unknowns $\lambda$ 
(\iref{IM_Lambda}) and $G$ (\iref{IM_E}).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:FS}
{F_\text{S}}= \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left[ {R_{i}}
	\;{\displaystyle\prod_{c=i}^{n-1} \Psi_{c}
	}\right] + {R_{n}} }{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left[ {T_{i}}
	\;{\displaystyle\prod_{c=i}^{n-1} \Psi_{c}
	}\right] + {T_{n}} }

\subsubsection*{Normal/Shear Force Ratio Derivation}

 From the moment equilibrium of \dref{GD_M}, with the primary assumption for 
 the Morgenstern-Price method of \aref{A_Base} and associated definition 
 \dref{GD_X}, Equation~(\ref{eq:Moment}) can be derived.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Moment}
  0 = \begin{array}{l} - {G}_{i} \left[ {h_{\text{z,}i}} -
      \frac{b_{i}}{2} { \tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)}

      \frac{b_{i}}{2} { \tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)}
      \right] - H_{i}\left[ h_{\text{z,w,}i} -
      \frac{b_{i}}{2} { \tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)}
      \right] \\[5pt] + H_{i-1}\left[ h_{\text{z,w,}i-1} +
      \frac{b_{i}}{2} { \tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)}
      \right] -\lambda \frac{b_{i}}{2} \left( G_{i}

    K_{\text{c}} W_{i} \frac{h_{i}}{2} - U_{\text{t,}i}
    \sin\left(\beta_{i}\right) h_{i} -
    Q_{i}\;{\sin\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
    h_{i} \end{array}
\end{equation} 

\noindent
Rearranging the equation in terms of $\lambda$ leads to 
Equation~(\ref{eq:lambda1}).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:lambda1}
  \lambda = \frac { \begin{array}{l} - {G}_{i} \left[
        {h_{\text{z,}i}} - \frac{b_{i}}{2} {
          \tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)} \right] +
      {G}_{i-1} \left[ {h_{\text{z,}i-1}} +
        \frac{b_{i}}{2} { \tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)}
        \right] - H_{i}\left[ h_{\text{z,}i} -
        \frac{b_{i}}{2} { \tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)}
        \right] \\[5pt] + H_{i-1}\left[ h_{\text{z,}i-1} +
        \frac{b_{i}}{2} { \tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)}
        \right] + K_{\text{c}} W_{i} \frac{h_{i}}{2} -
      U_{\text{t,}i} \sin\left(\beta_{i}\right) h_{i} -
      Q_{i}\;{\sin\left(\omega_{i}\right)}
      h_{i} \end{array} } { \frac{b_{i}}{2} \left[
      G_{i} f_{i} + G_{i-1} f_{i-1}
      \right] }
\end{equation}

\noindent This equation can be simplified by applying assumptions 
\aref{A_Seismic} and \aref{A_External}, which state that the seismic and 
external forces, respectively are zero.

\begin{equation*}
\lambda = \frac { \begin{array}{l} - {G}_{i} \left[
	{h_{\text{z,}i}} - \frac{b_{i}}{2} {
		\tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)} \right] +
	{G}_{i-1} \left[ {h_{\text{z,}i-1}} +
	\frac{b_{i}}{2} { \tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)}
	\right] - H_{i}\left[ h_{\text{z,}i} -
	\frac{b_{i}}{2} { \tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)}
	\right] \\[5pt] + H_{i-1}\left[ h_{\text{z,}i-1} +
	\frac{b_{i}}{2} { \tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)}
	\right] -
	U_{\text{t,}i} \sin\left(\beta_{i}\right) h_{i} \end{array} } 
	{ \frac{b_{i}}{2} \left[
	G_{i} f_{i} + G_{i-1} f_{i-1}
	\right] }
\end{equation*}

\noindent
Taking the summation of all slices, and applying \aref{A_EdgeSlices} to set 
$G_{\text{0}}$, $G_n$, $H_{\text{0}}$, and $H_n$ equal to zero, a general 
equation for the constant $\lambda$ is developed in Equation~(\ref{eq:Lambda}), 
also found in \iref{IM_Lambda}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lambda}
\lambda= \frac{ \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} { {b_{i}} \left[
      \left({{G}_{i} + {G}_{i-1}}\right) +
      \left({{H}_{i} + {H}_{i-1}}\right)
      \right]{\tan\left(\alpha_{i}\right)} \\ +
    {{h}_{i}}\;\left[ 
    -{2}\;{U_{\text{t,}i}}\;{\sin\left(\beta_{i}\right)} \right] }}
         {\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} { {{b}_{i}}\;{\left[{
                   {f_{i}}{{G}_{i}} +
                   {f_{i-1}}{{G}_{i-1}} }\right]} }}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Equation~(\ref{eq:Lambda}) for $\lambda$ is a function of the unknown
interslice normal force, $G$ (\iref{IM_E}), which itself depends on the unknown 
factor of safety, $F_\text{S}$ (\iref{IM_FS}).

\subsubsection*{Interslice Force Derivation} \label{sec:Ederivation}

This derivation is identical to the derivation for \iref{IM_FS} up until 
Equation~\ref{eq:Gi}, shown again below.

\begin{equation*}
G_i \Phi_i = \Psi_{i-1} G_{i-1} \Phi_{i-1} + 
F_\text{S} 
T_i - R_i
\end{equation*}

\noindent A simple rearrangement of Equation~\ref{eq:Gi} leads to 
Equation~\ref{eq:Interslice}, also seen in \iref{IM_E}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Interslice}
{G}_{i} = \frac{{\Psi_{i-1}}\;{{G}_{i-1}} +
  F_\text{S}{T_{i}} -
       {R_{i}}}{\Phi_{i}}
\end{equation}

\noindent The cases shown in \iref{IM_E} for when $i=0$, $i=1$, or $i=n$ are 
derived by 
applying \aref{A_EdgeSlices}, which says that $G_0$ and $G_n$ are zero, to 
Equation~\ref{eq:Interslice}. $G$ depends on the unknowns $F_\text{S}$ 
(\iref{IM_FS}) and $\lambda$ (\iref{IM_Lambda}).

\wss{We need something to explain that we pick the slip surface with the minimum
  factor of safety.  I'll give this some further thought on whether this is the
  best way to say it.}

\subsubsection{Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Tables~\ref{TblInputVar} and \ref{TblOutputVar} show the data constraints on 
the input and output variables, respectively. The column for physical 
constraints gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be 
taken by the variable. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the 
confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information 
would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification 
exercise. The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the 
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations. The column of typical values 
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.

\subsubsection{Properties of a Correct Solution} \label{sec_CorrectSolution}

\noindent
A correct solution must exhibit conformation to the system of non-linear 
equations presented in \iref{IM_FS}, \iref{IM_Lambda}, and \iref{IM_E}. In 
addition, the factor of safety for the critical slip surface must be lower than 
the factors of safety calculated for other slip surfaces compared by 
\iref{IM_Min}. The coordinates of the critical slip surface must form a concave 
up function.

\wss{It seems to me that the content of this section could all be deleted,
  except for the last sentence.  Saying that the solution agrees with the
 instance models is covered by the requirements.  The shape of the critical slip
 surface seems to be the only new information here.  What do you think BM?}

\bmac{I agree that the information is covered elsewhere. Even the last sentence 
is mostly covered by \aref{A_Concave}. I struggled to come up with content for 
this section.}

\section{Requirements} \label{sec_Reqs}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks
that the software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional
requirements, the qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

  inputs, shown in the table below, and store the data.

\end{table}

the 
input data lies within physical constraints shown in Table~\ref{TblInputVar}.

\iref{IM_FS}, \iref{IM_Lambda}, and \iref{IM_E}, calculate and

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\progname\ is intended to be an educational tool, therefore accuracy and
performance speed are secondary program priorities. Instead, the following 
non-functional requirements are prioritized:

\begin{itemize}
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfreqnum}\thenfreqnum \label{NFR_Correctness}:] 
Correctness, achieved if the outputs of the code have the properties described 
in \ref{sec_CorrectSolution}.
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfreqnum}\thenfreqnum \label{NFR_Understandability}:] 
Understandability, achieved if the code is modularized with 
complete module guide and module interface specification.
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfreqnum}\thenfreqnum \label{NFR_Reusability}:] 
Reusability, achieved if the code is modularized.
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfreqnum}\thenfreqnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:] 
Maintainability, achieved if the traceability between 
requirements, assumptions, theoretical models, general definitions, data 
definitions, instance models, likely changes, and modules is completely 
recorded in traceability matrices in the SRS and module guide.
\end{itemize}

\section{Likely Changes}

\noindent \begin{itemize}
\item[\refstepcounter{lcnum}\lthelcnum \label{LC_inhomogeneous}:] The system 
currently assumes the different layers of the soil are homogeneous 
(\aref{A_Homo}). In the future, implementation can be added for inconsistent 
soil properties throughout.
 
\item[\refstepcounter{lcnum}\lthelcnum \label{LC_Seismic}:] The system 
currently assumes no seismic force (\aref{A_Seismic}). In the future, 
implementation can be added for the presence of seismic force.

\item[\refstepcounter{lcnum}\lthelcnum \label{LC_External}:] The system 
currently assumes no external force (\aref{A_External}).
In the future, implementation can be added for an imposed surface load on the 
slope.
\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}
If changes were to be made with regard to the following,
a different algorithm would be needed.

\begin{itemize}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum}\ltheucnum \label{UC_insf}:] Changes related to 
\aref{A_Base} are not possible due to the dependency of the calculations on the 
proportional relationship between interslice normal and shear forces.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum}\ltheucnum \label{UC_inhomogeneous}:] \aref{A_2D} 
allows for 2D analysis with these models only because stress along 
$z$-direction is zero. These models do not take into account stress in the 
$z$-direction, and therefore cannot be used without manipulation to attempt 
3-dimensional analysis.
\end{itemize}

\bmac{This section is not on the template, not sure if it should be kept}

\wss{I'm going to think about adding this section to the template.  It is a way
  to show that some of the assumptions are critical to the identity of the
  problem.}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Tables~\ref{Table:trace} 
and~\ref{Table:trace2} show the dependencies of theoretical models, general 
definitions, data definitions, and instance models with each other. 
Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the dependencies of instance models, 
requirements, and data constraints on each other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} 
shows the dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data 
definitions, instance models, and likely changes on the assumptions.

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.
