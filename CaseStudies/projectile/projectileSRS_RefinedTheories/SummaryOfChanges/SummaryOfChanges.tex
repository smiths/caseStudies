\frametitle{Refined Theories Projectile}

\begin{itemize} %blue is new
\item Purpose %for Drasil dev, understanding, not actually expecting 62 pages on proj motion
\item Refinements starting from TM:acceleration
\item Relationship between Theories, Assumptions, Modelling Decisions and Data Constraints
\item Modelling Decisions and Assumptions
\item Scope Decisions
\item ``Support'' obligations from Final Theories
\item Rationale - for As, MDs, DCs, overriding As, (derivation of TMs, DCs)
\item System Context determines effort on rationale
\item Scope determines typical values
\item Context Theories
\item Types
\item Next Steps
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Refined Theories Continued}

\begin{itemize}

\item Separate table of symbols for separate sets of Theories?
\item Labelling should be updated (A, MD, SD, BT, remove GD?)
\item Inherit assumptions and data constraints, unless overridden
\item Theories are not inherited, since could get to a theory by different paths
\item Refine ``body'' to ``projectile'' to ``sack of potatoes?''
\item 
\end{itemize}
